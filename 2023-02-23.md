## Notes

Post-trip reflections•  Trip was a great success. Ewan said he enjoyed the shooting and ice hockey the most. We packed a lot in. Troy says he will be eating mostly cereal and salad for the next week! Oli seemed to enjoy the trip too.

• Reese and McKinley liked their tops. Cooper liked his, but needs the next size up.

• I like American people; directness seems to work with them, which suits my communication style.

• Kate had a demeanour that she was really pleased this trip had worked for Oli and me. 

• Ewan was a really good person to bring along … he fits in really well and is good company for Oli.

• I would go back to: Katz’s / A Rangers game / the 911 memorial tour / the Arlo

When I noticed on return:

• The dogs gave a very enthusiastic welcome … it’s great when they make a fuss

• I noticed how I have a lot of stuff which can make it difficult to find; also the bedroom is dark. So … improve illumination and remove unnecessary clutter

• I can still feel some stress / tension in my head and neck, but it’s not as bad as it was

• Find ways where I’m not reacting to unpredictable external triggers
  
• The trip to NY provided a real mental reset and I need to do more trips like this

## Questions

What are the things that I do which add the most value to my family and a large group of people outside of my family?
How can I design my environment so it works best for me?

## Summary

ake sure I’m doing more of what works for me, and optimises my energy
