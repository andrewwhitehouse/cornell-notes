## Notes

•  Really good conversation with Kate. Talking about the NY trip with Oli and Ewan, and holiday planning. We spoke from 6.40 NY time for about 45 minutes. I got a real sense that she is looking out for me.•  I still feel frazzled but this trip has given me the mental space to see a way forward.• What assets can I create with the skills I have now? Software? Media (books?) …

• I keep coming back to a spaced repetition app

• Self care is a top priority (because I’ve neglected it up to this point), so find a way to track how I’m doing on that

• Having the home environment sorted is important; it needs to be a pleasant and enjoyable place to live.

• Build in public to get feedback

• Make sure I’m taking into account my own needs, as well as those of my family

• Do more: unplug from my phone / meditate (exercise/go for walks) / build projects in public / write the book (because I can) / track spending more closely / go on holiday / encourage children to solve their own problems / recognise when I am reacting to others too much

• Do less: drink close to bedtime / fix others problems for them when I don’t need to

• Reading: Overcoming burnout / Skil the line / Navalmanac / From Strength to Strength
